        <h1>Discuss your understanding about Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences your learning</h1>
        <span class="question">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Understanding how Neuroplasticity works is beneficial because it gives people motivation to grow their brain. 
        If people understand that they can grow their brain and become smarter rather than having fixed thinking then they 
        are a lot more motivated to make that happen for themselves. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        I personally have learning difficulties and had depression at one point and the fact you can use Neuroplasticity to 
        help mitigate this blow my mine. I will constantly tell myself I can succeed in things and will seek out new ways to 
        continuously grow my brain from now on.  
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Think about the action you are wanting to grow in. Mentality is key! 
        <br>
        2. Practice, practice, practice, constantly make sure you practice and review things you have gone over before to 
        solidify the connections in your brain. 
        <br>
        3. Understanding that your brain is malleable increases the drive you have for growing it.

        <span class="question">Discuss what Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Growth Mindset is a particular way of thinking. It’s being open to the fact you can grow and shape your brain and 
        understand that your brain is not fixed. It is relevant because a lot of students these days get put into a belief 
        of thinking that they are born with the intelligence they have and that they can’t increase their brain potential 
        with a growth mindset. This restricts their learning and means they are focusing more on not looking dumb rather 
        than wanting increase their knowledge with a growth mindset.  
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        My mother always talked about this mindset when I was a kid but I never paid attention. After seeing the evidence 
        and the research I just did. I am going to be a lot more mindful and operate in a mindset of growth rather than 
        fixed thinking. I always believed you were born with the potential you had I didn’t realise how powerful a growth 
        mindset was. It also blew my mind that it can help with mitigating learning difficulties and depression. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        The biggest step is understanding that your brain is malleable and it’s not locked. I will constantly tell myself 
        I can achieve things rather than saying I can’t.

        <span class="question">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and 
        strategy.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        My Learning plan will remain the same but with an added conscious of thinking from me. More practice, practice, 
        practice. Not getting angry with myself when I can’t do something and instead, I will just tell myself ‘not yet’.
