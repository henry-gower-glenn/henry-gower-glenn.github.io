        <span class="question">Getting blocked on a simple problem</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        What was the problem: 
        <br>
        the problem was trying to figure out how 6 % 4 worked? It was devising it so I thought it should be using
        a / instead.
        <br>
        <br>
        What problem solving techniques did you use?
        <br>
        Google, Rubber Ducky method
        <br>
        <br>
        How did you feel throughout the process?
        <br>
        Curious and driven to find an answer
        <br>
        <br>
        What did you learn?
        <br>
        Its how many times does 4 go into 6? the answer is 1 with a remainder of 2. Should of been simpler but I found
        this difficult. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">Solved a problem in an elegant way.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        What was the problem: 
        <br>
        FizzBuzz for loop challenge
        <br>
        <br>
        What problem solving techniques did you use?
        <br>
        Reading error message, google, trying something, asking friends, rubber duck method. 
        <br>
        <br>
        How did you feel throughout the process?
        <br>
        Very lost and hopeless. I even messaged my facilitator to get some feedback as to whether or not im behind etc. 
        <br>
        <br>
        What did you learn?
        <br>
        The for loop is very similar to a while loop its just shorter. for (let i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {} means if the index (i) 
        is less than the arr.length add + 1 to (i), then return something as output. This took me a long time to understand and im still not exactly sure I have 
        it 100% on lockdown. But I will continue to pratice. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        Pseudocode - extremely little confidence, I dont understand how to break down the problem. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Trying something - I am very confident at this. This problem solving technique is what has 
        gotten me through this course so far
        <br>
        <br>
        Rubber ducky method - When I first learnt this problem solving technique I though it was kind of silly but the more I 
        progress through the course, the more im finding myself using it. I am very confident at using this method. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Reading error messages - My confidence is 50/50 with this one. I managed to solve about half the problems using the
        error message but there were about half I had no idea what I was reading. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Console.logging - I can see the power from console.logging. I am confident using it but I dont use it often and should 
        start to use it way more often to test my code. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Googling - Again 50/50 for me, I dont understand half the things im reading and tend to watch videos more as they are 
        easier to understand. I am starting to learn termanology little bit by little bit and reading on google is becoming easier.
        <br>
        <br>
        Asking your peers for help - I have been doing this but find it a bit like google where its hard to understand what 
        people are trying to tell me as they are using termanology I dont understand just like google. I need it explained in a
        more user friendly way. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Asking coaches for help - I tried doing this for a few problems I faced in the first couple of sprints but got refered 
        to the foundations channel and then told to ask them again if the problem persisted. Foundations has been able to answer
        all my questions so far so I have no experienced a problem persisting. 
        <br> 
        <br>
        Improving your process with reflection - I am not very good at this. I find reflecting on myself difficult for some
        reason and I havent figured out why just yet.
