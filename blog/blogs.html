        <h1>Topic Question: What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? </h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        The element is built up of four different components. The Content, Padding, Border, Margin. The border is in 
        between the padding and margin. If you increase the padding size you are pushing the border away from
        the content. If you increase the margin size you are moving the element further into the page. You use margin
        when you want to control the space outside the element/border and you use padding when you want to control
        the space inside of the element/border. You can control margin by using it like a clock. The first number would
        be margin: 40px which would push the element away from the top page by 40 pixels. the next number would be right,
        bottom and then left. Example margin: 40px, 40px, 88px, 72px.

        If CSS and HTML were a building the 'bones' of the building and how it is structured would be HTML and how the
        building looked, the color and the 'style' would be CSS.

        Control flow is the order in which statments and functions are executed. A loop is when you keep it keeps being executed
        until the statment is no longer true. An every day life example of this is going to work this would be considered a loop.

        The DOM is a way for people to change the document structure, style and content. It stands for Document Object Model and
        is a way to change and view the webpage which is a document. A reason why you might use the DOM is for viewing the padding,
        margin and border of an image.

        Objects are used to represent particular titles in your code. It could be a bulding, car, character etc. Arrays are used
        when wanting to create an ordered collection where items can be accessed using numbers like [0] or [1] etc. 
        <br>

        functions are like mini programs that we create to make our life a little more easier when coding. for example you can 
        use a function called math random to generate a random number. This is a mini program that someone has written to make 
        bigger projects easier to build.
