            <p1>
            Having Anxiety/depression. I had a decision to make to either seek counselling or continue staying in the position I was in. The verdict of the two outcomes was:
            
            1.	If I didn’t go to seek counselling, I would stop being depressed and feeling like the world is against me. I would also stop hurting the people around me who are trying to support me. 
            
            2.	If I did go to seek counselling I would have taken a stepping stone in the right direction. I can get some motivation and I can obtain multiple new ways to deal with my anxiety/depression. 
            
            So the values I was falling back on why I should go to counselling was for my family, for my own motivation 
            
            Describe how your culture has influenced your values? 
            
            The type of culture I grew up with was very loving and supportive. I’ve been taught to give everything a go and that failures are steppingstones to success. I believe anyone can do anything if they put their mind to it. The people around me are hard-workers and honest people. So, this helped shape some of my core values which is honesty and dedication/commitment. 
            
            Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
            
            My strengths are, I am a dedicated hard worker, I thrive at problem solving and slowly working things out. I am great in team environments where we all pitch in to reaching the same goal. I am open minded and very passionate. 
            
            Some limitations are, I don’t know when to stop or slow down from exhaustion. I can become anxious when trying to learn or develop my career which can prevent me form thriving in certain things. 
            
            I feel like dedication will help me a lot in this learning journey because I feel there is going to be lots of obstacles in the way and this could lead to frustration and lack of work but with my dedication and problem solving skills I will probably get enjoyment from this and the curiosity will take over. 
              
            I need to remember to balance out rest because I can over work myself very easily. My biggest strength is dedication and lack of giving up but if I’m not careful this could also be my biggest weakness so I need to be aware of this to ensure I am constantly using it as a strength. 
            
            
            
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
            
            I was helping my brother start up a meal replacement company. We never see eye to eye on things so ideas that he was bringing to the table I was disagreeing with and he was doing the same back to me. I was very passionate about leading the process and having my way that I didn’t take into consideration of others opinions. It wasn’t until I actually started being open minded and listening to what my brother had to say and we started making traction in a good direction. This made me learn that when working with others you must be open minded and able to accept criticism and other peoples opinion.
