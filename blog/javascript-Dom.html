        building looked, the color and the 'style' would be CSS.

        Control flow is the order in which statments and functions are executed. A loop is when you keep it keeps being executed
        until the statment is no longer true. An every day life example of this is going to work this would be considered a loop.

        The DOM is a way for people to change the document structure, style and content. It stands for Document Object Model and
        is a way to change and view the webpage which is a document. A reason why you might use the DOM is for viewing the padding,
        margin and border of an image.

        Objects are used to represent particular titles in your code. It could be a bulding, car, character etc. Arrays are used
        when wanting to create an ordered collection where items can be accessed using numbers like [0] or [1] etc.

        functions are like mini programs that we create to make our life a little more easier when coding. for example you can 
        use a function called math random to generate a random number. This is a mini program that someone has written to make 
        bigger projects easier to build.
