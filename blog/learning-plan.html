            <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
            <p1>•	What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? 

                My long term goal is to complete Dev Academy and then find a job as a junior front end developer. From there I would like to work my way into the back end and go from there. 
                
                •	A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning
                
                I am very determined to complete this goal. I have been out of the workforce for 3 years now due to sickness so I am very eager to get back out there and start working. I am very honest with myself and know when I’m getting off path and to ‘pull my head in’. I am very logical and coding is all about logic so I’m sure I can use this to my advantage. 
                
                I have ADHD which means my attention can be all over the place. I also have dyspraxia which means I ‘take a bit longer to absorb information’ than others. 
                
                •	What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
                
                My communication skills. I am requiring a lot of help but find it hard to seek it and have the confidence to post my possible ‘silly’ questions in the foundations slack channel. So I would like to try and build up my confidence and communication skills. 
                
                A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
                •	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
                •	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
                
                I try and use Toggl as best as I can to keep track off my time to ensure I at least put in 8-10 hour days. I make sure I exercise and eat properly every day to ensure my mind and body is in ‘working mode’. I try my best to keep to the recommended time targets even though I think some of them are unrealistic. I try and take regular small breaks if workloads are getting to me to ensure I’m always in the best frame of mind. I will seek help where needed to try and get myself out of potential holes. I will always use Google where I can to help out with sticky situations. 
                
                •	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
                
                I will always try and google it myself to see if I can solve it. I will then seek help in the Foundations and cohort chat if I can still not solve it. If the problem keeps persisting and I don’t have a resolution I will then ask a Foundations facilitator. 
                
                
                
                •	A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
                
                I expect the facilitation team to answer my queries where needed. To follow up on where I am at as a student and to make sure I have got the correct resources to complete the course. 
                
                •	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
                
                I have no other commitments, just making sure I give my all to this course.
                
                •	These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
                
                I decided to bullet point for easy reading purposes.
