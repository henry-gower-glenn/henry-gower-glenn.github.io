        <h1>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Reflecting on myself was difficult as I was focused so much on making sure I was learning the tech part properly.
        I actually got frustrated with how much time was being used for core.  
        <br>
        2. Sticking to recomended time frames was difficult.
        <br>
        3. Its hard not to be discouraged when so many people are completing the recomended tasks and I am not. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        Your values are going to be the thing that keeps you grounded and motivated to complete this course. People also need
        to be extremely self aware to ensure they are learning the required things and to not get side tracked easily. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        I struggle very much with talking about my values and sticking to recommended time frames.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        Talking about myself. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development 
        bootcamp course?</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        Because it helps bring self awareness to our learning journey and it also sets the students up better for job interviews
        as a lot of the time people are employing developers not just based of there coding skills but also there personality and
        work ethic etc. So by making us more aware about what was being taught in the Core Learning we might be more employable 
        in the work force. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to 
        practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        I understand that Core Learning is helpful and will be essential when looking for jobs. But the time frames need to be
        laid out better. I think Core leaning has too many hours invested into it. As a student that has come into this course
        with zero skills in coding, I would very much rather use the extra time to learn the technical parts. I have also done 
        other courses in life that try to make people self aware and talk about their values etc but at the end of the day I 
        would very much rather just be learning what I wanted to sign up to this course for, and that is CODING. To sum up: I 
        do believe what was taught in the Core Values part of foundations can be neccasary but it took up to much time in my 
        opinion and I would prefer to invest atleast half of the hours invested in Core learning to be invested in Tech learning.
