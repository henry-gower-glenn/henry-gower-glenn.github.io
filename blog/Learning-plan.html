        <h1>Bootcamp - Learning Plan - Sprint 5</h1>
        <span class="question"> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</span> 
        <br>
        <br>
        My long term goal is to complete Dev Academy and then find a job as a junior front end developer. 
        From there I would like to work my way into the back end and go from there. The company I would love to work for is Zip
        I would love to work for a startup company rather than an established company and I think BNPL companies are the next big 
        thing.  
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</span> 
        <br>
        <br>
        My biggest strength will be my determination to complete this course. My biggest limitation will be my learning 
        disadvantages and making sure my mentality does not feel like I am being left behind or am terrible at coding. I felt a bit
        like this during foundations.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Asking questions when necassary, I feel like after seeing people post in the slack channel during bootcamp that I am 
        miles behind them in skill level and so I dont want to feel like I am stupid for asking potentially silly questions 
        when everyone else understands whats going on. Although I thought having access to slack channel was an advatage, it 
        can also play on your mind about how far behind you are compared to others. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        better time management. Sometimes I can get lost down rabbit holes and its nice to constatly have time reminders on how 
        much time I should be investing into a particular exercise, even though I think some of the times provided were unrealistic.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        For teachers to answer all questions asked. For Dev Academy to ensure I am learning at a decent speed and I 
        am not being left behind. To make studying life less stressful where possible. To constantly check-up and ask where I am up
        to and how I am going. 1 on 1 tutoring if required to ensure I pass this course. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        To ensure I ask for help in a timely manner by asking the slack channel, facilitators, teachers, friends and google. 
        I will ensure I am investing a minimum of 60 hours a week and will try my best at completing the work that is provided 
        to me in the most timely manner possible. I will make sure I get up early and have exercised and eating properly to ensure 
        my body is always ready for learning. I will be considerate towards others and will try answer other peoples queries when 
        possible.

        <h1>Learning Plan - Sprint 2</h1>
        <span class="question"> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</span> 
        <br>
        <br>
        My long term goal is to complete Dev Academy and then find a job as a junior front end developer. 
        From there I would like to work my way into the back end and go from there. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question"> A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</span> 
        <br>
        <br>
        I am very determined to complete this goal. I have been out of the workforce for 3 years now due to 
        sickness so I am very eager to get back out there and start working. I am very honest with myself and 
        know when I’m getting off path and to ‘pull my head in’. I am very logical and coding is all about logic 
        so I’m sure I can use this to my advantage. I have ADHD which means my attention can be all over the place. 
        I also have dyspraxia which means I ‘take a bit longer to absorb information’ than others. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question"> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself 
        while at EDA?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        My communication skills. I am requiring a lot of help but find it hard to seek it and have the confidence
        to post my possible ‘silly’ questions in the foundations slack channel. So I would like to try and build up 
        my confidence and communication skills. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question"> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators 
        and industry/community representatives What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to 
        you </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        I try and use Toggl as best as I can to keep track off my time to ensure I at least put in 8-10 hour days. 
        I make sure I exercise and eat properly every day to ensure my mind and body is in ‘working mode’. I try my 
        best to keep to the recommended time targets even though I think some of them are unrealistic. I try and take 
        regular small breaks if workloads are getting to me to ensure I’m always in the best frame of mind. I will 
        seek help where needed to try and get myself out of potential holes. I will always use Google where I can to 
        help out with sticky situations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question"> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        I will always try and google it myself to see if I can solve it. I will then seek help in the Foundations 
        and cohort chat if I can still not solve it. If the problem keeps persisting and I don’t have a resolution 
        I will then ask a Foundations facilitator. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question"> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        I expect the facilitation team to answer my queries where needed. To follow up on where I am at as a student 
        and to make sure I have got the correct resources to complete the course. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="question"> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
        For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in. </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        I have no other commitments, just making sure I give my all to this course.
